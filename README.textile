h2. Options

|_.Option|_.Type|_.Default Value|_.Description|
|autoPlay|Boolean|true|When true, the SlideShow will automatically start looping over the slides.|
|slideDuration|Number|5|The number of seconds that an individual slide will be visible.|
|transitionDuration|Number|The number of seconds that a transition from one slide to another will occur.|
|loop|Boolean|true|When true, the SlideShow will start over from the first slide when it is done displaying the last slide.|
|crossFade|Boolean|false|When true, the SlideShow's transition will simultaneously fade out a slide while fading in the next. This uses Effect.Parallel. If set to false, the next slide will wait for the previous one finish fading before appearing.|
|pauseOnMouseover|Boolean|true|When true, if the mouse cursor hovers over the SlideShow area, the SlideShow will pause. Playback will resume upon mouseout.|
|slidesSelector|String|'> &#8727;'|A CSS selector that matches the intended slide elements. By default, selects the immediate descendants of the root SlideShow element.|

|events|Object|{ init: 'dom:loaded', play: 'window:loaded' }|An object containing two properties, *init* and *play*. Init is the when event observers are attached. Play is when the SlideShow will attempt to automatically start playing if autoPlay is set. By default, these settings will allow for a SlideShow that is part of the original document to work. If a SlideShow is created after the original document is loaded, as is often the case with AJAX, custom events may be used to start a slideshow.|
|beforeStart|Function|Prototype.emptyFunction|Allows for a function to be executed prior to the initial playback.|
|afterFinish|Function|Prototype.emptyFunction|Allows for a function to be executed after a loop as completed.|
